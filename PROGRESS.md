# ClauseLens — Progress

Started: 2026-10-19 · Plan: 10 build days + 3 buffer days (counting build days, not calendar days)

## Versions

| Version | Day | What you can do with it |
|---|---|---|
| v0.1 | 1 | 15 questions in code + checked answers (gold) for 5 leases + tests |
| v0.2 | 2 | Talk to Gemini reliably (retry, backup model, saved answers, cost log) |
| v0.3 | 3 | Read a PDF and split it into clauses with page numbers |
| v0.4 | 4 | Find the right clauses for a question (accuracy measured) |
| v0.5 | 5 | AI fills the 15 facts; each checked against the PDF; first accuracy number |
| v0.6 | 6 | Classifier (is this a lease?) + risk checks + human review of unsure answers |
| v0.7 | 7 | Ask questions, get answers with clause citations; backend API |
| v0.8 | 8 | One-command accuracy report; safety tests; hide personal data |
| v0.9 | 9 | Web page + Docker |
| v1.0 | 10 | GitHub-ready: README, diagram, real numbers, demo |
| extra | 11–13 | Catch up first; then compare two leases |

## Day 1 — DONE (2026-10-24)

Built:
- Project set up with uv (pyproject.toml, uv.lock, .gitignore)
- `src/clauselens/schemas/lease.py` — 15 questions + 3 rules (found / not_stated / unclear), written by Rohan
- `eval/gold/lease_01..05.json` — 75 answers, every quoted line verified to exist on its page, reviewed by Rohan
- `tests/test_lease.py` — gold files valid + checker rejects broken data
- First git commit

Test results: all tests passed (run by Rohan on his Mac)

Found:
- ₹ symbol extracts as "■" from these PDFs → handle on Day 3
- Tests caught a real bug: "licence" vs "license" spelling mismatch
- All 5 leases are GPT-made, clean style → add 3–5 real public templates later
- `late_fee` is not_stated in all 5 leases → cannot be scored yet

Decisions:
- Every fact = answer + exact line + page + status
- v1 = leases only; other contract types = new schema file later
- Cut from v1: deposit-deduction reasons list; names/addresses never extracted
- Classifier (doc type) on Day 6 is separate from LLM Router (Day 2)

Build days used: 1 of 13 (took 6 calendar days — mostly learning setup concepts)

## Day 2 — next: LLM Router
